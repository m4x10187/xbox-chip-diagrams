Notes on the "Tightmod" installation



Chip info:

The following installation instructions are based on a sst29lf020 bare-wired bios chip coded with the "evo m7" bios.

Bios:

You must use the m7 or 4977 bios (ive only tested M7, so use the alt at your peril).  I havent had time to test any of the linux based bios's yet, so if anyone tries these please email me with your results and ill credit you for the testing.


Altenative point Lframe (This point MUST be done on all 1.3+ machines):

When soldering to the Lframe (7) on use a dressmakers needle or a syringe to scrape off the green tack on the via (i used a syringe).  Next use a cotton bud, some fluxcene, and some rubbing to prep the via (no room for error on this join). tape the pre-cut pre-tinned kynar wire down first and bend it into position (see finished pic) so that there will be zero resistance when you solder it into place.  Now, making sure your have a fresh dob of solder on your weller temp controlled iron with  .2 or less clean tip, heat the wire up as you push it into the via (remove the iron when you feel heat in your fingers). When you have tested that you have a good conection (aka the motherboards bolted in and you can load evolutionx off a disc) then you may drip 1 drop of tarzans grip super gue on the join to prevent from coming loose if you drop your xbox, this will take 1-3 hours to set (the 10sec dry time merely referes to your fingers :D).  Superglue is not conductive so dont use it to make the initial join and do not use hotmelt, the nvidia chip will melt it when it gets hot (duh).  You may play the xbox while it sets (this actually makes it set faster), just dont move it for 3 hours to be safe.


3.3volt (2) issues:

This point is only nessesary on the 1.5, but works perfectly well on the 1.3/1.4 and is easy enough to do, so ive included it in the 1.3 diags to save confusion.


D-zero (D0):

This is the same on all models so i havent listed this on the alternative points diagrams, the alt points diagram are only a supplement.  You may use the top D0 via point if you like which i have not put here, cos i dont think its the best one. But for all you people to lazy to pull the m/board out then yes it works.


Credits:

Greets goes to Andy Green for his cheapmod design, ive refined the design to be even cheaper, which is one of the reasons ive named this one a "tightmod" or "tightarse mod" (if you do the alternat Lframe youll find another reason to call it a tightmod).  I have to give credit to Romeo for tracing the LFrame point on the 1.3.  Also greets to all those who have worked on anything else that i havent had time to mention.  If i forgot to mention your work then please email me with the forumn evidence and ill update you.

Final note:

So much for impossible :D

Xtrmod 1.3 beta Mod Chip Installation Directions
You must have:

    * Flux - used for a better contact and to avoid dry joints
    * De-solder Braid - used for cleaning solder from the board incase of mistakes
    * Soldering Iron - see picture
    * Solder - Obvious
    * Screw Drivers - torx 10 & 20 to open the box
    * Wire - A fine single gage wire, Kynar is recommended.
    * A steady hand and good light

Trouble Shooting:
On/Off green red flashing light means you have one of the solder points through the holes not making a contact with the solder points on the board. 

Step by Step:
1: Put some solder at the LPC port points at the Xbox mainboard.
2: Place the X-ecuter on it, so that the holes match the points of the port.
3: Put some solder on your soldering iron. Stick your soldering iron in a right angle into the holes - press.
4: Pull the soldering iron back.
